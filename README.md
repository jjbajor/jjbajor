<h3>📖 My Story</h3>
Minecraft is the reason I do what I do.
<br/>
<br/>
Alright, I know that sounds silly, but let me explain. When I was a kid, I always loved to play video games. Shocker, right? Up until college, I always hopped on xbox after school with friends to blow off steam and make some memories. We would play an assortment of games, including Call of Duty, Overwatch, Destiny, Halo, etc. These games all formed the foundation of my childhood, but none more than Minecraft did.
<br/>
<br/>
With hundreds of blocks & textures, the possibilities of creation are truly endless. I began my journey by following building tutorials on YouTube. Honestly, my builds looked terrible at first. But through years of honing my building skills and styles, I began to construct amazing creations. Villages, castles, rocket ships, boats, dragons, and more; you name it, I've built it. Upon experimenting with redstone, which eventually sparked my curiosity with circuits and computers, I could truly call myself quite an experienced builder.
<br/>
<br/>
This curiosity & desire to create awesome things with tech eventually brought me to the obvious subject to study: computers. Specifically, the creative side of technology and design. Through college, I've taken some amazing classes and have been lucky enough to work with some extremely talented people. I'm so excited to see what the future has in store for me.
